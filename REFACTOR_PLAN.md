## 📞 Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Peridot Fonts:** Do you have the Peridot font files? If not, we'll need a fallback strategy.
2. **Partners Page Content:** Do you have partner logos, bios, and content ready?
3. **Where to Buy:** Do you want location-based search or just a list of retailers?
4. **Animation Intensity:** Do you want subtle or bold entrance animations?
5. **Mobile Menu Style:** Full-screen overlay or slide-in drawer?
